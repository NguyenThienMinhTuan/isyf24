        The ISYF student organizing committee is made up of 40 friendly, fun and
        caring facilitators from the Science Student's Research Club, SMTP-GATE
        Council and other affiliates from Hwa Chong Institution, Singapore. We
        are guided by a team of dedicated teachers from Hwa Chong Institution
        and we're excited to have you here for the first physical ISYF since the
        pandemic!

        As your facilitators, we have planned an exciting array of activities
        including an Amazing Race and a cultural exhibition. In fact, what you
        have seen in the Programme Overview is just a slight preview of what you
        can experience here. It is our greatest hope that you'll not just take
        away valuable scientific insights from the forum, but also long-lasting
        friendships with people all over the world.

        We believe the 5 days of ISYF will be an exciting and enriching
        experience for you. You can look forward to the cultural exhibition,
        learning and experiencing the vibrant and unique cultures of each and
        every participant from various countries. In a typical day, you can
        expect engaging dialogue sessions or lessons with eminent scientists in
        our Dialogue sessions and Masterclasses, and an opportunity to visit
        Singapore's own industries and universities for further insight into the
        research culture in Singapore. Most importantly, a typical day is best
        described as the memories and joy you had with all your friends you have
        made during ISYF!

        Yes you will. In fact, the rooms of the boarding school that you'll be
        staying in are either 2 bedders or 4 bedders. Your roommates are likely
        to be delegates from other countries. We believe that this is an
        invaluable opportunity for you to form close friendships and create
        precious memories.

        There are self-launderette facilities (washing machines located on the
        ground floor of Halls B, E and G) available for usage in the boarding

        Bed sheets will be provided already upon check in to the boarding

        towels and toiletries (soap, toothbrush etc.) sufficient for the course
        of ISYF as the Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School does not provide
        these.

        Most of your meals here will be catered from reputable catering
