  <h2>Reconnecting, Reimagining: Looking Ahead to a Better World</h2>
  <p>
    It has been more than two years since COVID-19 first emerged, bringing about
    unprecedented challenges and changes for the world. No corner of the world
    has escaped unscathed. However, the pandemic has also provided humankind an
    invaluable opportunity to rethink some fundamental assumptions and mindsets,
    and to consider how to build more resilient communities going forward. It
    has led many people around the world to embark on a journey of accelerating
    transformation and imagining our world anew, with Science playing a key role
    in this journey. How can we, as catalysts for change, better drive
    humankind's progress, anchored on the scientific method and discipline? In
    the spirit of redefining boundaries and galvanising transformation, ISYF
    2023 endeavours to inspire delegates to use Science and Technology to lead
    the change into the future by reconnecting, reimagining, and looking ahead,
    to create a better world marked by common goals, shared knowledge and global
    solidarity.

  <h2>Inspire Passion for Science Among Youth</h2>
  <p>
    ISYF aims to provide high-ability students with ample opportunities to share
    and discuss their interest in science, technology and science research. They
    will be exposed to many fields of science which will broaden their outlook
    and understanding of the scientific world. Invited Nobel laureates and
    eminent scientists will inspire them through stories of their own life
    experiences and scientific discoveries. These interactions will help create
    greater awareness among the youth about the importance of broad-based
    knowledge, keen curiosity, relentless tenacity and a global outlook when
    considering the pursuit of science as a meaningful and fulfilling endeavour.

  <h2>

  </h2>
  <p>
    Students will have many opportunities to interact in different
    cross-cultural groups and forge strong bonds with each other throughout the
    Forum. Activities are designed to promote mutual cooperation, understanding
    and appreciation of each other's diverse cultures while sharing a common
    passion in science, technology and research.
